This is a bullet hell game I made
With BTD6-style pixel art.
When it loads you press space to start the game 
after a countdown it starts and its a boss battle
where you attack a modifyed BAD ballon.
As the BAD's health goes down 75%->50%->25% the frequency of 
attacks increases and the BAD gains some attacks like a charge 
attack where it fires bullets while sweping across one
side of the screen.
Once the BAD gets to 0% health it enters a desperation 
phase where it forces the player on one side and it 
rapidly shoots bullets that splits with increasing 
frequency as the phase goes on until the BAD or the 
player runs out of time.
After that there will be a winning screen if the player wins
or a losing screen if the player loses
